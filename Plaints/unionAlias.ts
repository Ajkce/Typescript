//This is an union type which is separated with or operator. The values of the input can be either one of them but you will get an error when you try to perform activities related to only on type
// For eg: If you try to change input1.toUpperCase() you will get an error becasue it is not valid on number type. so in order to perform those activities we will first check the type with if statements and then perform the operations related to the type
